# Hurricane Survival Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting hurricane survival based on various personal attributes. The project uses data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to train and evaluate two models: XGBoost and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.

## Contents

1. `hurricane_survival_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. `Final_Report.pdf`: Detailed report of the project, including methodology, results, and discussions.
3. `World_MO_Hurricane_Survival.csv`: The dataset used for this project, containing information about individuals and their survival status during hurricanes.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of XGBoost and MLP models
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics and ROC curves
- Visualization of results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, tensorflow, matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `hurricane_survival_classification.ipynb`

## Results

The models achieved moderate accuracy in predicting hurricane survival. For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the Final Report.
